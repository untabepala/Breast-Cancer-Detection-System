# Breast-Cancer-Detection-System
An advanced breast cancer detection system. This project leverages several cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to ensure early and accurate diagnosis.
# Technologies and Methodologies Used:
Logistic Regression: Our system utilizes logistic regression, a robust statistical model for binary classification, to predict the presence of breast cancer based on a variety of medical data inputs. This algorithm helps in determining the probability of cancer, providing a clear and interpretable outcome.

Standard Scaler: To ensure that our data is processed accurately, we implemented a standard scaler for feature scaling. This technique standardizes the range of independent variables or features of data, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the prediction model.

Flask for Backend: Our backend infrastructure is built using Flask, a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python. Flask handles the server-side logic, processes user inputs, communicates with the machine learning model, and returns the prediction results efficiently.

Bootstrap for Frontend: For the user interface, we employed Bootstrap, a popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework. Bootstrap allowed us to create a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing frontend that ensures a seamless user experience across various devices.

# Project Highlights:
Early Detection: By integrating logistic regression and data scaling techniques, our system enhances the accuracy of early breast cancer detection, potentially improving patient outcomes.

User-Friendly Interface: The combination of Flask and Bootstrap provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easy for healthcare professionals to input data and receive results.

Efficient Data Processing: The use of standard scaling ensures that our model handles the input data effectively, leading to more reliable predictions.
